# Shipment Tracker 

A callout is made to the Apex method when the component loads using wire and the response is rendered to the LWC component. 

Once the response is fetched it is displayed back to the user.

Here is the output https://github.com/NaveenCherukuru123/Merz/blob/main/screenshots/1.jpeg

To get the output of the LWC we need to drag and drop the LWC on to the record page (as shown here https://github.com/NaveenCherukuru123/Merz/blob/main/screenshots/2.jpeg)
